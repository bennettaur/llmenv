# Testing Best Practices

## Test Structure
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- One assertion per test when possible
- Group related tests in describe/context blocks

## Test Coverage
- Aim for high test coverage but focus on critical paths
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Include integration tests for key workflows
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Test Organization
- Mirror the source code directory structure in tests
- Use factory patterns for test data creation
- Keep test data minimal and relevant
- Use beforeEach/setUp for common test setup

## Performance Testing
- Include performance tests for critical operations
- Set reasonable timeout limits
- Test with realistic data volumes
- Monitor and benchmark key metrics
