# Terraform Infrastructure Guidelines

## Code Organization
- Use modules for reusable infrastructure components
- Organize resources by environment and service
- Use meaningful names for resources and variables
- Group related resources in the same file
- Use consistent naming conventions across all resources

## Best Practices
- Use remote state with state locking
- Pin provider versions in configuration
- Use data sources instead of hardcoded values
- Implement proper tagging strategy for all resources
- Use workspaces for environment separation

## Security
- Never commit sensitive values to version control
- Use variable files (.tfvars) for environment-specific values
- Implement least-privilege access policies
- Use encrypted state storage
- Regularly audit and rotate access keys

## Testing and Validation
- Use `terraform plan` before applying changes
- Implement automated testing with tools like Terratest
- Use `terraform validate` and `terraform fmt` in CI/CD
- Test infrastructure changes in staging environments
- Document infrastructure decisions and changes

## State Management
- Use remote backends (S3, Terraform Cloud, etc.)
- Implement state locking to prevent concurrent modifications
- Backup state files regularly
- Use separate state files for different environments
- Be cautious with state file modifications
